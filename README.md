# This project-based assignment enables master’s students to apply Big Data concepts through a practical, end-to-end pipeline using Hadoop, Spark, Hive, and MLlib. Students will begin with a brief theoretical exploration of Big Data’s role in business, followed by hands-on tasks involving data ingestion, processing, and machine learning on a large public dataset. The project is designed to be environmentally flexible; students may use cloud platforms, Docker, or local IDEs. Each task builds on the previous one, promoting a real-world workflow and culminating in a reflection on challenges, tools used, and future improvements.
